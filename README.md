# Jelly Lines

This is a HTML5 remake of the famous [Color Lines](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Lines) game.<br>
The project was build with [Angular](https://github.com/angular/). All the graphics were made using CSS only.<br>
The game is just an experiment in using Angular for relatively complex animations and reactive game loop.
